first create context folder

create two file one for the context and the other one for state

in context file create context using createContext();
and then do export default.

in state file we will keep that state whom we want to make accessible globally.
in state file import the context as NoteContext.

then add the below snippet in state file

const NoteState=(props)=>{
    return(
        <NoteContext.Provider>
            {props.children}
        </NoteContext.Provider>
    )
}
export default NoteState;

then in state wala file create an object which contain all the state which are global
and the pass this object as value props of  NoteContext.provider value={state}


now wrap the whole app inside  
<NoteState></NoteState> so that we will be able to use the states globally

to use context in any component wrap inside NoteState 
first import useContext from reactjs
then 
const allstate=useContext(NoteContext)
now we can access state 
allstate.name and allstate.class and so on....
